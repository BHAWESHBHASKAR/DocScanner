### API Keys Setup

#### OpenRouter (for DeepSeek AI) API Key:
1. Go to [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) and create an account
2. After logging in, navigate to the API Keys section
3. Click "Create API Key" and give it a name related to this project
4. Copy the generated API key (starts with "sk-or-v1-...")
5. Add this key to your `.env` file as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

#### Mistral AI API Key:
1. Visit [Mistral AI Platform](https://console.mistral.ai/) and create an account
2. Go to the API section in your dashboard
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy the API key (starts with a unique identifier)
5. Add this key to your `.env` file as `MISTRAL_API_KEY`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BHAWESHBHASKAR/DocScanner.git
   cd DocScanner
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Update the following variables in `.env`:
   - SECRET_KEY: Your Flask secret key (a random string for security)
   - OPENROUTER_API_KEY: Your OpenRouter API key from the steps above
   - MISTRAL_API_KEY: Your Mistral AI API key from the steps above

5. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python db_management.py migrate
   ```

6. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## üìã Sample Documents and Testing

The repository includes sample documents in the `sample_documents` directory to help you test the similarity detection features:

### Test Documents:
1. `ai_doc1.txt` and `ai_doc2.txt`:
   - Similar documents about artificial intelligence
   - Expected similarity score: ~70-80%
   - Use these to test semantic similarity detection

2. `climate_doc.txt`:
   - Different topic (climate change)
   - Expected similarity score with AI docs: <30%
   - Use this to verify dissimilar content detection

### Quick Testing Steps:
1. After setting up the application:
   - Login with admin credentials
   - Upload `ai_doc1.txt`
   - Then upload `ai_doc2.txt`
   - You should see a high similarity score
   - Upload `climate_doc.txt` to verify low similarity detection

2. Testing Features:
   - Document comparison view
   - Similarity scores
   - Match highlighting
   - Credit system functionality

### Expected Results:
- High similarity between AI documents demonstrates semantic matching
- Low similarity with climate document shows accurate differentiation
- System should identify key phrases and concepts
- Match details should show relevant text comparisons
